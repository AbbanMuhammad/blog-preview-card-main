## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom propertie

### What I learned

I learned a lot also from this challenge, especially how to use box-shadow. In CSS I've learned how to make image to fluid inside its container.

```css
.container{
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 20px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.9);
}
```
